# MAC121-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-I
 Program Exercises for the first Algorithms-and-Data-Structures course at IME-USP
 
Goals:
Introduce basic programming techiques, data structures, and notions of design and analysis of algorithms, through examples.
 

Program:
Informal notions of proof of correctness and evaluation of performance of algorithms. Notions of abstract data types. Arrays. 
Strings. Dynamic memory allocation and array resizing. Pointers. Linked lists. Non-linear linked structures. Binary trees. 
Stacks and queues (implemented with arrays an linked lists). Applications. Priority queues (implemented with heaps). 
Applications. Recursion. Applications. Elementary sorting algorithms. Quicksort. Mergesort. Heapsort. Radixsort. Indirect sorting (pointer sorting). 
Elementary text processing. Applications. Elementary symbol tables: implementations based on arrays, linked lists, binary search, and binary search trees. Applications. 
The applications may involve various composite data structures (such as arrays of linked lists) and various algorithmic strategies (greedy, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, backtracking, breadth-first-search, etc.).
